# Brunel-R-stats-workshop

The purpose of this seminar series is to provide Doctoral Researchers with the material and skills needed to improve their approach to research. By increasing their awareness of different statistical techniques and software, we hope that DRs will be able to apply what they learn from this set of workshops beyond the scope of their PhD and into their professional careers. 

We have created a program that should cover basic components of data analysis (e.g., t-tests and correlations) and review the basic theory behind these analyses to establish a solid foundation as we progress to more complex methods and analyses. These seminars will be organized by DRs and led by both volunteer faculty members and Doctoral Researchers who are well versed in the topics to be taught. We will promote the use of open-access software and encourage best practices around data collection, analysis and sharing. We expect that as well as improving the quality of research, this will help foster a more engaged research community across the two research centers within the Psychology division.
